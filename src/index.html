      <h2><span class="star-text">Empowering</span> Indian SME.</h2>

      <p>The economic and banking importance of the SME sector is well recognized in academic and policy literature. Problem arises when a substantial portion of the SME sector may not have the security required for conventional collateral based bank lending, not high enough returns to attract formal venture capitalists and other risk investors.  Also, with the GST being implemented, it threw a mix big of opportunities and challenges for SMEs to explore.</p>

      <p>Therefore, we as a team  are completely mindful of its accompanying challenges such as increase in compliance costs and alignment of IT systems with new processes. We try to provide the best solutions for boosting business activities.</p>
